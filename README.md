# CSE327_Project.

# Introduction
# Our project is basically for them who run the fitness center. Those who will operate the software, first they will get information of gyms in a certain area and be able to add or update the information of all the members of their center and calculate their income and expenditure etc. and sell exercise equipment through this one software. On the other hand, users can buy exercise equipment at home and users can become a member of that organization by purchasing a membership package and as a result they will get some special benefits.
