# CSE327_Project.

# Introduction

Our project is basically for those who run the fitness center. Those who will operate the software will first get information on gyms in a certain area and be able to add or update the information of all the members of their center, calculate their income and expenditure, etc., and sell exercise equipment through this one software. On the other hand, users can buy exercise equipment at home, and they can become members of that organization by purchasing a membership package, and as a result, they will get some special benefits.
