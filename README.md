# CSE327_Project.

# Introduction

Our project is basically for those who run the fitness center. Those who will operate the software will first get information on gyms in a certain area and be able to add or update the information of all the members of their center, calculate their income and expenditure, etc., and sell exercise equipment through this one software. On the other hand, users can buy exercise equipment at home, and they can become members of that organization by purchasing a membership package, and as a result, they will get some special benefits.

# Our Target Audience

Our main audience is conscious men, women, and children of all ages who like to change their lifestyles. They can schedule any time for workouts at their convenience. Just as they can buy products at home, they can also subscribe to a membership at home.

# Why do we need this application?

Gym members and officials can access the system from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to manage the gym and access information.
This automates many manual tasks associated with managing a gym, such as membership management, scheduling, and billing. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors.
Often, regular gym usage is not possible at work. The online gym contains a lot of body-weight exercises that can be completed at home.
However, gym members will get special discounts on the same equipment and products. Moreover, certain facilities, like personal trainers, buying membership online, discount offers, etc. will be available to members only. 
On the other hand, those who run a fitness center used to need two different software. One is to manage their gym data, and the other is if they are selling any products. But now they can do these two things together through software and at the same time can register for membership online at home.
